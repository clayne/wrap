## Basic Installation
Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should configure,
build, and install this package.  The following more-detailed instructions are
generic; see the `README' file for instructions specific to this package.  Some
packages provide this `INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features
documented below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found in *note
Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
