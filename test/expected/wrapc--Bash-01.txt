# Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU #
# Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.  Released in
# 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating
# system and as a default shell on Linux and OS X.
#
# The name itself is an acronym, a pun, and a description.  As an acronym, it
# stands for Bourne-again shell, referring to its objective as a free
# replacement for the Bourne shell.  As a pun, it expressed that objective in a
# phrase that sounds similar to born again, a term for spiritual rebirth.  The
# name is also descriptive of what it did, bashing together the features of sh,
# csh, and ksh.
