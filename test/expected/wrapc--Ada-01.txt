-- Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and
-- object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from
-- Pascal and other languages.  It has built-in language support for
-- design-by-contract, extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, offering
-- tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism.
--
-- Ada was originally designed by a team led by Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell
-- Bull under contract to the United States Department of Defense (DoD) from
-- 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by
-- the DoD.  Ada was named after Ada Lovelace (1815-1852), who is credited with
-- being the first computer programmer.
