//
// C++ is a general-purpose programming language.  It has imperative, object-
// oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities
// for low-level memory manipulation.
//
// Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne
// Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he
// wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided
// high-level features for program organization.

  std::cout << "hello, world\n";
