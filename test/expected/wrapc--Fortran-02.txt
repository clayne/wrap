!
! Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from "Formula Translation") is a
! general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to
! numeric computation and scientific computing.
!
! Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
! applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and
! has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally
! intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element
! analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics and
! computational chemistry.
!
! It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for
! programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.
