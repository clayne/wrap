! Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and
! Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo,
! by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard.  Syntactically, it is a fairly
! faithful superset of ALGOL 60.
!
! Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual
! procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage
! collection.  Also other forms of subtyping (besides inheriting subclasses)
! were introduced in Simula derivatives.
!
! Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.  As its
! name suggests, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of
! that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-
! oriented languages today.
