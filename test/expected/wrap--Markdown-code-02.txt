1. C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting
   structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static
   type system prevents many unintended operations.

        #include <stdio.h>

        int main( void ) {
          printf( "hello, world\n" );
        }

   While small test programs existed since the development of programmable
   computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello world!" as a test
   message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book "The C
   Programming Language."

2. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
   instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that
   had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems,
   as well as various application software for computers ranging from
   supercomputers to embedded systems.
