/*
 * C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
 *
 *     #include <stdio.h>
 *
 *     int main( void ) {
 *       printf( "hello, world\n" );
 *     }
 *
 * While small test programs existed since the development of programmable computers,
 * the tradition of using the phrase "Hello world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book "The C Programming Language."
