  // Because of:
  // 
  //    Ibid: if a variable marker contains one or more commas, then the last
  //    comma is treated as introducing the width modifier, and all others are
  //    treated as grouping separators.
  //  
  // we have to count the number of commas in order to know when we've reached
  // the last one.
