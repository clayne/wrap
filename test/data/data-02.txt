** Added command-line option aliases.
Both wrap and wrapc now support aliases.  An alias is a user-defined,
short-hand name for command-line options that are frequently used together.

** Added configuration file.
Both wrap and wrapc now read a configuration file (if present) on startup that
defines aliases and patterns.
