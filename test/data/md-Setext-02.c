  // Basic Installation
  // ==================
  //    Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
  // configure, build, and install this package.  The following
  // more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
  // instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
  // `INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
  // below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
  // necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
  // in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
