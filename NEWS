* Changes in Wrap 4.0

** Added Markdown support.
Wrap and wrapc now have a -u option that enables wrapping of Markdown text.

** Added leading string option.
Wrap now has a -L option that allows a leading string to be prepended to every
line.

* Changes in Wrap 3.3

** Added whitespace prototype option.
Wrap now has a -P option that treats the leading whitespace on the first line
as a prototype for all subsequent lines.

** Added comment-delimiters option.
In wrapc, the comment delimiter characters can now be overridden via the new -D
command-line option.

** Added special-case handling of delimited block comments.
In wrapc, delimited block comments are now handled specially in that the first
and last lines are not altered.

** Added special-case handling of non-comment lines.
In wrapc, if the first line isn't a comment, then the leading whitespace alone
is used as a prototype for subsequent lines.

** Added block characters option.
In wrapc, blocks of text started by certain characters can now delimit
paragraphs via a new -b command-line option.  This allows things like Javadoc
or Doxygen @ characters, e.g., @param, to remain on their own lines.

* Changes in Wrap 3.2

** Improved leader handling.
In wrapc, the leader used to be defined as ^[{WS}{CC}]* (where WS are
whitespace characters and CC are comment characters) but this didn't work well
with comments like " // * Bullet"; hence the leader is now defined as
^{WS}*{CC}+{WS}*.

** Now using standard sysexits exit codes.
Exit codes are now those specified by sysexits(3).

* Changes in Wrap 3.1

** Fixed extraneous trailing whitespace.
Comment lines that contained only leading whitespace and the comment delimiter
no longer have trailing whitespace added.

** Stops wrapping text upon non-comment line.
If a line is encountered that does not start with whitespace followed by
comment delimiters, it signals the end of the comment and all remaining lines
are passed through verbatim.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0.3

** Now using C99.
Now using C99 as the minimum required C version.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0.2

** Changed wrapc algorithm.
Wrapc now strips leading characters anew for each line preventing the loss of
characters for subsequent lines that are indented less than the first.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0.1

** Fixed handling of long lines.
Lines longer than line-width are now handled correctly.

** Fixed handling of ragged lines in wrapc.
Comment lines that don't all start with the same number of delimiters are now
handled better.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0

** Added command-line option aliases.
Both wrap and wrapc now support aliases.  An alias is a user-defined,
short-hand name for command-line options that are frequently used together.

** Added configuration file.
Both wrap and wrapc now read a configuration file (if present) on startup that
defines aliases and patterns.

** Added end-of-sentence option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -e command-line option for specifying that
whitespace after an end-of-sentence character delimites a paragraph.

** Added file-matching patterns.
Both wrap and wrapc can now apply command-line options (via aliases) to files
automatically based on their names matching a pattern.

** Added input/output file options.
Both wrap and wrapc now have -f and -o command-line options for specifying the
input file to read from and the output file to write to, respectively.

** Added [nt]roff/man-page file support.
Wrap now has a -d command-line option that does not alter lines that begin with
a '.' (dot) presumed to be [nt]roff control lines.

** Added paragraph-delimiter option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -p command-line option that allows additional
characters to be specified as paragraph delimiters.

** Added tab-spaces option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -s command-line option for specifying the number
of spaces that a tab character should be considered the same as.

** Added title option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -T command-line option that treats the first
line of every paragraph as a title and puts it on a line by itself.

** Added UTF-8 support.
Wrap now correctly handles UTF-8 encoded text by always considering multi-byte
characters as having a width of 1.

** Changed "length" to "width".
With the addition of UTF-8 support, it sounds better to use "width" (as in
character and line width) rather than "length."  Consequently, the -l option
has been deprecated in favor of the new -w option.

** Fixed wrapc short-line bug.
A bug whereby reading a comment line that has fewer characters than the number
of leading characters of the first line resulted in lines being incorrectly
folded has been fixed.

* Changes in Wrap 1.0

** Initial version.
