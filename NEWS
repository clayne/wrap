* Changes in Wrap 3.0.3

** Now using C99
Now using C99 and the minimum required C version.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0.2

** Changed wrapc algorithm.
Wrapc now strips leading characters anew for each line preventing the loss of
characters for subsequent lines that are indented less than the first.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0.1

** Fixed handling of long lines.
Lines longer than line-width are now handled correctly.

** Fixed handling of ragged lines in wrapc.
Comment lines that don't all start with the same number of delimiters are now
handled better.

* Changes in Wrap 3.0

** Added command-line option aliases.
Both wrap and wrapc now support aliases.  An alias is a user-defined,
short-hand name for command-line options that are frequently used together.

** Added configuration file.
Both wrap and wrapc now read a configuration file (if present) on startup that
defines aliases and patterns.

** Added end-of-sentence option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -e command-line option for specifying that
white-space after an end-of-sentence character delimites a paragraph.

** Added file-matching patterns.
Both wrap and wrapc can now apply command-line options (via aliases) to files
automatically based on their names matching a pattern.

** Added input/output file options.
Both wrap and wrapc now have -f and -o command-line options for specifying the
input file to read from and the output file to write to, respectively.

** Added [nt]roff/man-page file support.
Wrap now had the -d command-line option that does not alter lines that begin
with a '.' (dot) presumed to be [nt]roff control lines.

** Added paragraph-delimiter option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -p command-line option that allows additional
characters to be specified as paragraph delimiters.

** Added tab-spaces option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -s command-line option for specifying the number
of spaces that a tab character should be considered the same as.

** Added title option.
Both wrap and wrapc now have a -T command-line option that treats the first
line of every paragraph as a title and puts it on a line by itself.

** Added UTF-8 support.
Wrap now correctly handles UTF-8 encoded text by always considering multi-byte
characters as having a width of 1.

** Changed "length" to "width".
With the addition of UTF-8 support, it sounds better to use "width" (as in
character and line width) rather than "length."  Consequently, the -l option
has been deprecated in favor of the new -w option.

** Fixed wrapc short-line bug.
A bug whereby reading a comment line that has fewer characters than the number
of leading characters of the first line resulted in lines being incorrectly
folded has been fixed.

* Changes in Wrap 1.0

** Initial version.
