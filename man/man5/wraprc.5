.SH NAME
wraprc \- text reformatter runtime configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B wraprc
file is used to configure
.BR wrap (1)
and
.BR wrapc (1).
The file is line-oriened with different line types:
.P
.PD 0
.IP "\(bu" 3
Blank lines (that are ignored).
.IP "\(bu" 3
Section lines.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Configuration lines.
.PD
.P
Additionally,
all leading and trailing whitespace characters
as well as all characters starting with
.B #
to the end of the line (which are comments)
are ignored.
.P
The file is broken down into sections
where each section is started by a line of the form:
.P
.RS 5
.RI [ section-name ]
.RE
.P
that is a left bracket,
a section name,
and a right bracket.
There must be no whitespace between the brackets.
.SS Aliases Section
The
.I "aliases section"
is started by a line:
.cS
[ALIASES]
.cE
An
.I alias
is a short-hand name
for command-line options
that are frequently used together.
For example:
.cS
html = -ep,;:
.cE
creates an alias named
\f(CWhtml\f1
for the options shown.
Once specified,
an alias can be requested via the
.B \-a
option
to either
.B wrap
or
.BR wrapc .
For example:
.cS
wrap -a html
.cE
would be the same as:
.cS
wrap -ep',;:'
.cE
Note that some options don't make sense
in a configuration file
and are therefore forbidden there.
Those options are:
.B \-a
(alias),
.B \-c
(configuration file),
.B \-C
(suppress configuration file),
.B \-f
(input file),
.B \-F
(input file name),
.B \-o
(output file),
and
.B \-v
(version).
.SS Patterns Section
The
.I "patterns section"
is started by a line:
.cS
[PATTERNS]
.cE
A
.I pattern
is used to apply aliases automatially
when a file matching that pattern is wrapped
using the
.B \-f
or
.B \-F
option.
For example:
.cS
*.html = html
.cE
creates a pattern that matches all files ending in
\f(CW.html\f1
(HTML files)
and will apply the options specified by the previously defined
\f(CWhtml\f1
alias.
.P
A file may match more than one pattern
in which case the options of the corresponding aliases
are applied in order of match.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
The user's home directory:
used to locate the default configuration file.
If unset,
the home directory is obtained from the password database entry
for the effective user.
If that fails,
no default configuration file is read.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.wraprc
The default configuration file.
