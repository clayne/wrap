.SH NAME
wrap \- text reformatter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrap
.BI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wrap
is a filter for reformatting text by wrapping and filling lines
to a given
.IR line-width ,
the default for which is 80 characters.
Lines are wrapped at
.I whitespace
characters.
A whitespace character is any character for which
.BR isspace (3)
returns non-zero
and always includes:
space (ASCII 32),
tab (9),
line-feed (10),
vertical-tab (11),
form-feed (12),
and
carriage-return (13).
.P
Non-whitespace control characters are discarded.
A control character is any character for which
.BR iscntrl (3)
returns non-zero.
.SS Whitespace Folding
Consecutive whitespace characters
are folded into a single space
with the following exceptions:
.nr step 1 1
.IP \n[step]. 3
Force two spaces after the end of a sentence that ends a line;
sentences are ended by an ``end-of-sentence'' character, that is, a
period, question-mark, or an exclamation-point, optionally
followed by a single-quote, double-quote, or a closing
parenthesis or bracket.  
.IP \n+[step].
Allow two spaces after the end of a sentence that does not end a line.
This distinction is made so as not to put two spaces after
a period that is an abbreviation and not the end of a sentence;
periods at the end of a line will hopefully not be abbreviations.
.IP \n+[step].
If neither the
.B \-n
nor the
.B \-N
option is specified,
two consecutive newline characters delimit a paragraph and are not folded;
more than two are folded.
If
.B \-n
is specified,
newlines receive no special treatment.
If
.B \-N
is specified, every newline delimits a paragraph.
.IP \n+[step].
If the
.B \-d
option is specified,
a line beginning with a `\f(CW.\fP' (dot),
presumed to be an
.RB [ nt ] roff (1)
control line,
is not altered.
.IP \n+[step].
If the
.B \-u
option is specified,
exceptions are made in order to pretty-print Markdown text
(see
.B MARKDOWN FORMATTING
below).
.SS Character Encoding
Text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.
All multiple-byte, UTF-8-encoded characters
are considered to have a width of 1.
UTF-8 Byte-Order Marks (BOMs)
are discarded.
.SH OPTIONS
An option argument
.I f
means
.IR file ,
.I n
means
.IR "unsigned integer" ,
and
.I s
means
.IR string .
.TP
.BI \-a " s"
Specifies the alias name
.I s
from the configuration file to be used.
This overrides any alias
from a matched pattern
via either the
.B \-f
or
.B \-F
options.
.TP
.BI \-b " s"
Specifies the set of ``block'' characters
.I s
that,
when the first non-whitespace character on a line,
delimits a paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-c " f"
Specifies the configuration file
.I f
to read
(default is
.BR ~/.wraprc )
if warranted.
.TP
.B \-C
Suppresses reading of any configuration file,
even one explicitly specified via
.BR \-c .
.TP
.B \-d
Does not alter lines that begin with a
.RB ` . '
(dot) presumed to be
.RB [ nt ] roff (1)
control lines.
.TP
.B \-e
Treats whitespace after an end-of-sentence character as a paragraph delimiter.
.TP
.BI \-f " f"
Reads from file
.I f
(default is standard input).
.TP
.BI \-F " f"
Sets the file-name to
.I f
as if it were being read from
but still reads from standard input.
(This allows the file-name to be matched against a pattern
in a configuration file to use an alias
while still allowing
.B wrap
to be used as part of a shell pipeline.)
.TP
.BI \-h " n"
Hang-indents
.I n
more tabs for all but the first line of each paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-H " n"
Hang-indents
.I n
more spaces for all but the first line of each paragraph
after any tabs.
.TP
.BI \-i " n"
Indents
.I n
more tabs for the first line of each paragraph.
.TP
.BI \-I " n"
Indents
.I n
more spaces for the first line of each paragraph after any tabs.
.TP
.BI \-l " s"
Specifies the line-endings to use
.IR s ,
one of
\f(CW-\fP,
\f(CWi\fP,
or
\f(CWinput\fP
(whatever the input uses, the default);
\f(CWcrlf\fP,
\f(CWd\fP,
\f(CWdos\fP,
\f(CWw\fP,
or
\f(CWwindows\fP
(DOS/Windows: CR+LF);
or
\f(CWlf\fP,
\f(CWu\fP,
or
\f(CWunix\fP
(Unix: LF);
all case-insensitive.
.TP
.BI \-L " s"
Specifies a string
.I s
that is to be prepended to every line.
.TP
.BI \-m " n"
Mirrors tabs; equivalent to:
.BI \-t n
.BI \-q m
where
.IR "m = line-width \- tab-spaces * n" .
.TP
.BI \-M " n"
Mirrors spaces; equivalent to:
.BI \-S n
.BI \-w m
where
.IR "m = line-width \- 2n" .
.TP
.B \-n
Does not treat newlines as paragraph delimiters.
.TP
.B \-N
Treats every newline as a paragraph delimiter.
This option is useful for line-breaking code prior to printing.
.TP
.BI \-o " f"
Writes to file
.I f
(default is standard output).
.TP
.BI \-p " s"
Treats the given characters in
.I s
as paragraph delimiters.
.TP
.B \-P
Treats the leading whitespace on the first line
as a prototype for all subsequent lines.
.TP
.BI \-s " n"
Sets
.I tab-spaces
(the number of spaces a tab character should be considered the same as)
to
.I n
characters
(default is 8).
.TP
.BI \-S " n"
Prepends
.I n
leading spaces to each line after any leading tabs.
.TP
.BI \-t " n"
Prepends
.I n
leading tabs to each line.
.TP
.B \-T
Treats the first line of every paragraph as a title
and puts it on a line by itself.
.TP
.B \-u
Format Markdown text
(see
.B MARKDOWN FORMATTING
below).
.TP
.B \-v
Prints the version number to
.I stderr
and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w " n"
Sets
.I line-width
to
.I n
characters
(default is 80).
.TP
.B \-W
Treats a line beginning with whitespace as a paragraph delimiter.
.SH MARKDOWN FORMATTING
Via the
.B \-u
option,
.B wrap
can reformat Markdown text.
Unlike most Markdown formatters,
.B wrap
reformats Markdown to Markdown
(to make the source text itself look nice)
and not to some other format,
e.g., HTML.
As such,
only block elements of Markdown need be supported
since span elements play no role in reformatting
and need to be treaded no differently from the surrounding text.
.P
The Markdown elements that are currently supported
are those offered by the original Markdown
(except blockquotes)
plus code fences from PHP Markdown Extra
plus nested lists from GitHub Flavored Markdown.
.SS Paragraphs
Paragraphs,
one or more consecutive lines of text
separated by one or more blank lines,
are reformatted as normal.
.SS Headers
Setext-style headers are supported:
.cS
This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------
.cE
Any number of \f(CW=\fP's or \f(CW-\fP's will work
and need not match the number of characters
on the preceding line.
Atx-style headers are also supported:
.cS
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
.cE
that is 1\-6 \f(CW#\fP characters.
Optionally,
atx-style headers may be ``closed''
with trailing \f(CW#\fP characters,
but the number of closing \f(CW#\fP characters
need not match the number of opening characters.
Headers of either style
.I must not
be indented.
.SS Unordered/Bulleted Lists
Unordered lists use asterisks, plusses, and minuses
(interchangably)
as list item markers:
.cS
* Red
* Green
* Blue
.cE
Markers may be indented by up to 3 spaces and
.I must
be followed by a space.
Multiline items may either be hang-indented:
.cS
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ligula suspendisse nulla pretium,
  rhoncus tempor fermentum, enim integer ad vestibulum volutpat.
+ Nisl rhoncus turpis est, vel elit, congue wisi enim nunc
  ultricies sit, magna tincidunt.
.cE
or not:
.cS
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ligula suspendisse nulla pretium,
rhoncus tempor fermentum, enim integer ad vestibulum volutpat.
+ Nisl rhoncus turpis est, vel elit, congue wisi enim nunc
ultricies sit, magna tincidunt.
.cE
Items may be separated by blank lines:
.cS
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ligula suspendisse nulla pretium,
  rhoncus tempor fermentum, enim integer ad vestibulum volutpat.

+ Nisl rhoncus turpis est, vel elit, congue wisi enim nunc
  ultricies sit, magna tincidunt.
.cE
Items may be multiple paragraphs
where the first line of subsequent paragraphs
.I must
be indented,
but others need not be:
.cS
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ligula suspendisse nulla pretium,
  rhoncus tempor fermentum, enim integer ad vestibulum volutpat.

  Nisl rhoncus turpis est, vel elit, congue wisi enim nunc
  ultricies sit, magna tincidunt.

+ Maecenas aliquam maecenas ligula nostra, accumsan taciti.
Sociis mauris in integer, a dolor netus non dui aliquet,
sagittis felis sodales, dolor sociis mauris, vel eu libero
cras.

  Faucibus at. Arcu habitasse elementum est, ipsum purus pede
porttitor class, ut adipiscing, aliquet sed auctor, imperdiet
arcu per diam dapibus libero duis.
.cE
(The original Markdown specification
.I requires
subsequent paragraphs to be indented by
.I 4
spaces;
.B wrap
allows paragraphs to be indented less
to match the hang-indent.)
.P
When reformatted,
multiple-line items are
.I always
hang-indented.
.SS Ordered/Numbered Lists
Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period and a space:
.cS
1. Chocolate
2. Vanilla
3. Strawberry
.cE
When reformatted,
out-of-sequence numbers will automatically be renumbered
starting at the first number.
(This follows PHP Markdown Extra.)
.P
Aside from using numbers as list item markers,
everything else about unordered lists
applies to ordered lists.
.SS Nested Lists
The original Markdown specification
does not support nested lists;
other Markdowns and
.BR wrap ,
however,
do.
Nested lists
.I must
be indented 4 spaces per nesting level
and may be any mixture or unordered and ordered lists:
.cS
1. First outermost list item.
    * First nested list item.
    * Second nested list item.
2. Second outermost list item.
.cE
Nested lists support blank lines
and multiple-line and multiple-paragraph list items.
.SS Code Blocks
Code blocks
are one or more lines
indented by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab:
.cS
In C, the program to print ``hello, world'' is

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
      printf( "hello, world\\n" );
    }

Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using.
.cE
Code blocks are passed through unaltered.
Code blocks nested inside lists
.I must
be indented
.I twice
\(em 8 spaces or 2 tabs.
.SS Fenced Code Blocks
Alternatively,
code blocks may be ``fenced,''
that is a sequence of lines
starting with 3 or more
non-indented tildes or backticks
and ending with the same number of the same character:
.cS
~~~
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf( "hello, world\\n" );
}
~~~
.cE
Fenced code blocks are passed through unaltered.
.SS Horizontal Rules
Horitontal rules
(lines separating sections of a document)
are three or more
hyphens,
asterisks,
or
underscores
on a line by themselves.
Any amount of whitespace may also be used.
Examples include:
.cS
---
***
___
* * *
----------
.cE
Since a non-indented \f(CW---\fP
would be ambiguous with a Setext 2nd-level header,
the latter
.I must
have a non-blank line preceding it.
.SS Block-Level HTML
Block-level HTML are lines
that are bracketed by a beginning and ending tag
of any HTML element:
.cS
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Aha!</td>
  </tr>
</table>
.cE
HTML blocks are passed through unaltered.
Unlike the original Markdown specification,
the beginning and ending HTML tags
need not be separated from surrounding text
by blank lines
and the tags may be indented
by up to 3 spaces.
However,
the beginning and ending tags must be on lines by themselves.
.SS Links
Neither inline nor reference links need any special treatment;
however,
reference link label lines such as:
.cS
[1]: https://github.com/paul-j-lucas/wrap
.cE
are passed through unaltered.
Link labels may be indented by up to 3 spaces.
The URL may optionally be followed by title
enclosed in one of
double quotes,
single quotes,
or parentheses:
.cS
[1]: https://github.com/paul-j-lucas/wrap "Wrap"
.cE
The title attribute may instead be put on the following line,
optionally indented by any number of spaces or tabs:
.cS
[md]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
    "Markdown"
.cE 0
