.SH NAME
wrapc \- comment reformatter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wrapc
.BI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wrapc
is a filter for reformatting program comments by
wrapping and filling lines to a given
.IR line-width ,
the default for which is 80 characters.
.P
Leading white-space and comment delimiters are preserved.
The characters that are recognized as comment delimeters are:
.P
.PD 0
.IP "\f(CW!\f1" 10
HTML and XML comments.
.IP "\f(CW#\f1" 10
CMake, Make, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Shell comments.
.IP "\f(CW/\f1 and \f(CW*\f1" 10
C, C++, and Java comments.
.IP "\f(CW%\f1" 10
PostScript comments.
.IP "\f(CW:\f1" 10
XQuery comments.
.IP "\f(CW;\f1" 10
Assember and Lisp comments.
.IP "\f(CW>\f1" 10
Forwarded mail indicator.
.PD
.P
All other white-space characters are folded
in the same manner as in
.BR wrap (1).
.SH OPTIONS
An option argument
.I f
means
.IR file ,
.I n
means
.IR "unsigned integer" ,
and
.I s
means
.IR string .
.TP
.BI \-a " s"
Specifies the alias name
.I s
from the configuration file to be used.
This overrides any alias
from a matched pattern
via either the
.B \-f
or
.B \-F
options.
.TP
.BI \-c " f"
Specifies the configuration file
.I f
to read
(default is
.BR ~/.wraprc )
if warranted.
.TP
.B \-C
Suppresses reading of any configuration file,
even one explicitly specified via
.BR \-c .
.TP
.B \-e
Treats white-space after an end-of-sentence character as a paragraph delimiter.
.TP
.BI \-f " f"
Reads from file
.I f
(default is standard input).
.TP
.BI \-F " f"
Sets the file-name to
.I f
as if it were being read from
but still reads from standard input.
(This allows the file-name to be matched against a pattern
in a configuration file to use an alias
while still allowing
.B wrapc
to be used as part of a shell pipeline.)
.TP
.BI \-l " n"
Deprecated.
Now a synonym for
.BR \-w .
.TP
.BI \-o " f"
Writes to file
.I f
(default is standard output).
.TP
.BI \-p " s"
Treats the given characters in
.I s
as paragraph delimiters.
.TP
.BI \-s " n"
Sets
.I tab-spaces
(the number of spaces a tab character should be considered the same as)
to
.I n
characters
(default is 8).
.TP
.B \-T
Treats the first line of every paragraph as a title
and puts it on a line by itself.
.TP
.B \-v
Prints the version number to
.I stderr
and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w " n"
Sets
.I line-width
to
.I n
characters
(default is 80).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PD 0
.IP 0
Success.
.IP 1
Error in command-line.
.IP 2
Error in configuration file.
.IP 3
Out of memory.
.IP 10
Error opening file for reading.
.IP 11
Read error.
.IP 12
Error opening file for writing.
.IP 13
Write error.
.IP 20
.BR fork (2)
failed.
.IP 21
.BR exec (2)
failed.
.IP 30
Caught signal from child process.
.IP 40
.BR pipe (2)
failed.
.PD
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B $HOME
The user's home directory:
used to locate the default configuration file.
If unset,
the home directory is obtained from the password database entry
for the effective user.
If that fails,
no default configuration file is read.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.wraprc
The default configuration file.
A configuration file,
even one explicitly specified via
.BR \-c ,
is neither actually checked for existence nor read
unless one of the
.BR \-a ,
.BR \-f ,
or
.B \-F
options
is specified
since it doesn't affect the result.
.SH BUGS
The first comment line is used at the prototype for all subsequent lines.
The number of characters comprising
the leading white-space and comment delimiters
of the first comment line
is removed from the start of each line
before being passed to
.B wrap
for reformatting.
After reformatting,
the prototype characters
of the first comment line
are inserted at the start of each line.
.P
This works fine if all the comment lines
have the same leading white-space and comment delimiters;
if not,
subsequent lines' leading characters
become the same
as those of the first
and/or
leading characters can be discarded.
.SH EXAMPLE
While in
.BR vi ,
wrap the comment from the current line to the end of the paragraph:
.cS
!}wrapc -F'%'
.cE
The \f(CW%\f1 argument to the
.B \-F
option is expaned by
.B vi
to be the file's path name.
To lessen typing,
the above can be mapped to a key sequence in
.BR vi 's
\f(CW.exrc\f1
file:
.cS
map `c !}wrap -F'%'\f3^M\f1
.cE 0
